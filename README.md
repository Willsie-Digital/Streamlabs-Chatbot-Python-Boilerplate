# Nyanagotchi!

We took 3 pop cultural phenomenons and mashed them all into sweet chatbot app that you can unlease on your viewers. We took Nyan Cats, Tomagatchi, and Casino Horse Racing and mashed them all into this... Nyanagotchi!

Your viewers will be able to adopt, feed, clean and play with their own Nyan Cat that will be called upon at random to race against 5 other viewers Nyan Cats. Racing where you can bet based off of odds that are generated based off the health of viewers Nyan Cats. The less healthy your Nyan Cat is, the less likely it will win, they higher the pay out if it does.

## Commands

- !nyan feed (item) - Use your points to buy yummy delicious nyan cat food and feed it to your adopted Nyan Cat. But be careful, if you feed it too much it will get diabetes and die.
- !nyan clean (item) - Use your points to buy various cleaning items to keep your Nyan Cat clean and STD free.
- !nyan play (item) - Use your points to buy various toys and play with your Nyan Cat. A Healthy Nyan Cat is a Fast Nyan Cat... It is also a hungrier Nyan Cat...

- !nyan putdown - Maybe you're going to be neglecting your Nyan Cat for a while or perhaps Nyan Cat broke it's paw in a race. Whatever the case may be you might need to put your Nyan Cat down... R.I.P. in peace kitteh.
